=======

Simple, hacked together Go package that assists in uploading a project to [CurseForge](http://www.curseforge.com/).

Currently only works with Git repositories.

### Why?

CurseForge does support using a SCM (git, svn, hg) to upload your project and automatically package it, but
for some reason the packager bugs out sometimes. Forcing you to open a support ticket to get your project
queued up. Decided to make a tool myself to do the same thing.

### Notes

It's very simple and basic. You can modify the code to suit your needs.
